    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 x 7g packets dry yeet</li>
      <li>1 cup caster sugar</li>
      <li>pinch of salt</li>
      <li>4 1/4 cups plain flour</li>
      <li>220g butter, chilled and cut into small cubes</li>
      <li>3 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>vegetable or light olive oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat milk over low heat until just warm (overheating will kill yeast). Remove from heat and pour into a jug. Add yeast, 2 tablespoons caster sugar, and salt. Whisk with a fork until well-combined. Allow to stand for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sift flour into a large bowl. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add 1/4 cup caster sugar, stirring until well-combined. Make a well in the centre. Add yeast mixture and eggs. Mix until well-combined. Drop mixture onto a floured surface. Knead for 10 minutes. Place dough into a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Stand in a warm place for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining caster sugar and cinnamon on a plate. Knock down dough and turn onto a lightly floured board. Cut dough in half and knead each piece for 5 minutes. Roll one piece out to 1 1/4cm thick. Cut 8cm circles with a biscuit cutter. Using a 4cm round cutter, cut out centre of each circle to form donuts. Continue with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Half-fill a frypan with oil. Heat over medium heat until oil is hot. Add 2 to 3 donuts at a time, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Toss donuts, one at a time, in cinnamon sugar until well-coated.</li>
    </ol>
